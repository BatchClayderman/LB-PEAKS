# LB-PEAKS

This is the official implementation of the LB-PEAKS cryptography scheme (``Post-Quantum Searchable Encryption Supporting User-Authorization for Outsourced Data Management``) in Python programming language. 

This repository is a part of the [cryptography schemes](https://github.com/BatchClayderman/Cryptography-Schemes). 

## Option

- [/n|-n|n]: Specify that the following option is the value of $n$ (default: $256$). 
- [/m|-m|m]: Specify that the following option is the value of $m$ (default: $9728$). 
- [/q|-q|q]: Specify that the following option is the value of $q$ (default: $4093$). 
- [/h|-h|h|/help|--help|help]: Show this help information. 

## Usage

- ``python "LB-PEAKS.py" [/n|-n|n] n [/m|-m|m] m [/q|-q|q] q``
- ``python "LB-PEAKS.py" [/h|-h|h|/help|--help|help]``

## Example

- ``python "LB-PEAKS.py"``
- ``python "LB-PEAKS.py" /n 256 /m 9728 /q 4093``
- ``python "LB-PEAKS.py" --help``

## Exit Code
- ``EXIT_SUCCESS`` ($0$): The Python script finished successfully. 
- ``EXIT_FAILURE`` ($1$): The Python script finished not passing all the verifications. 
- ``EOF`` ($-1$): The Python script received unrecognized commandline options. 

## Note

1) All the commandline options are optional and not case-sensitive. 
2) The commandline parameters will be appended to the parameter list specified by the user within the script. 
3) The parameters $n$, $m$, and $q$ should be positive integers that are greater than $1$. 
4) The parameters $n$ and $m$ should meet the requirement that $2n | m$. Otherwise, they will be set to their default values respectively.
